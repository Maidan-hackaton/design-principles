          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>Give people what they want to know without going into detail, eg the rate and how long it's paid for. Don’t use one long paragraph. Separate the main points.</p>

          <h2 id="main-sections">Main sections</h2>
          <p>You’ll meet the user’s need by:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>sticking to the title and need</li>
            <li>resisting the temptation to provide information around the subject </li>
            <li>using examples for complex calculations (use example Markdown)</li>
            <li>sticking to the common case – put unusual cases in ‘Further information'</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 id="further-information">Further information</h2>
          <p>This isn't a dumping ground. Content still needs to be useful. If you can't find a place for it, don't use it.</p>
          <p>The  main information needed is: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>effect on other benefits</li>
            <li>appeals and edge cases</li>
            <li>more information on how things like calculations, cases and benefits are worked out</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
      </article>
    </li>
  </ol>
